 # Iris Dataset Classification ðŸŒ»
 In this Project the following processes are done in the iris.csv dataset 
 * Loaded the Iris dataset into Python environment. Scikit-learn package to load the dataset.
 * Pre-processed the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets.
 * Explored the dataset by visualizing the data using scatterplots & histograms.
 * Selected a machine learning algorithm to train model. Started with a simple algorithm like K-Nearest Neighbours & Decision Trees.
 * Trained the model using the training set.
 * Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set.
 * Used the model to make predictions on new data.
 * Tested model by inputting new values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to see the predicted species of iris flower.

 Finally DONE ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜‰ !
